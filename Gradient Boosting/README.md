# Optimizing Classification Dataset

### Task:
Given a dataset (~60 features and ~970 samples), try to optimize using any classification model.

### Approach:
Utilizing gradient boosting algorithm from Sklearn, due to its . Once a foundation is built, I will then transfer to other libraries known for these algorithms.
